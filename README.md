# Turtle-crossing

### This is my new novel game in Python.

<h1>How does this work?</h1>

<br></br>

<h3> Using "W" and "S" keys, one can move turtle up and down, and in turn try his/her best to avoid being hit by the moving "cars"</h3>
<h3> As you reach the finish line your level increases. Has full stack integration with backend(no code heroku cloud hosted backend) to record high scores of each player or each session played over a timeframe.</h3>


  


<h3> You are free to read the code and suggest necessary pull requests to make the game more efficient</h3>
