# Turtle-crossing

### This is my new novel game in Python.

<h1>How does this work?</h1>

<br></br>

<h3> Using "W" and "S" keys, one can move turtle up and down, and in turn try his/her best to avoid being hit by the moving "cars"</h3>
<h3> As you reach the finish line your level increases. </h3>
